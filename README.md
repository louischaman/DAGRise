# Readme

This tool is meant to read in an R script and split it into smaller subscripts that read and write from binary files.

This means if you edit one part of your script or the data it won't need to re-run the longer processes.

It joins the scripts together using snakemake so you will need R and python

Run initiate.bash to setup your directory

Have fun
